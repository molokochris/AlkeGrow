# AlkeGrow

## Problem

Smallholder farmers often struggle to compete with large-scale farmers because they cannot afford to buy or rent agricultural inputs in bulk. This limits their growth and ability to enter new markets.

## About the name

The name AlkeGrow comes from the ancient name for Africa, Alkebulan. It means **"Mother of Mankind" or "Garden of Eden"**. We chose this name because we believe that Africa is a land of great potential, and we want to help smallholder farmers to **realize that potential**.

## About the team

AlkeGrow is being developed by **The App Brewery**, a team of passionate developers who are committed to using technology to **solve real-world problems**. We are excited to be working on this project and we believe that AlkeGrow has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of **smallholder farmers in Africa**.
