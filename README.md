# AlkeGrow

## About the name

The name AlkeGrow comes from the ancient name for Africa, Alkebulan. It means **"Mother of Mankind" or "Garden of Eden"**. We chose this name because we believe that Africa is a land of great potential, and we want to help smallholder farmers to **realize that potential**.
